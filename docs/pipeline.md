# Project structure

The repository intentionally keeps only the scaffolding:

- `src/desi_cmb_fli/` – package root with version metadata and shared utilities.
- `tests/` – minimal tests that confirm the package imports and helpers work.
- `docs/` – MkDocs pages that you can extend as your project grows.
- `configs/` – placeholder directory for experiment or run-time configuration files.
- `figures/` – placeholder directory for generated plots or assets.
- `scripts/` – utility scripts; currently only metadata helpers are provided.

Reintroduce modules, notebooks, or workflows inside these folders as your thesis
project takes shape.
