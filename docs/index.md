# thesis-desi-cmb-fli

Welcome to the documentation for the stripped-down thesis repository. The goal
is to provide a ready-to-extend scaffold with working docs, packaging, and test
infrastructure while leaving the scientific implementation up to you.

Use this space to capture the big-picture goals of your project once you start
adding code again. For now it serves as a landing page for the development
skeleton.
