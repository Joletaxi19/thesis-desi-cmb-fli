# thesis-desi-cmb-fli

Public research code and reproducible pipeline for Field-level inference (FLI)
combining DESI galaxy clustering and CMB lensing (Planck PR4; ACT later).

This repo now includes a fast, CPU-only synthetic baseline to compare FLI with a
3×2pt-like analysis on the same data. It demonstrates end-to-end wiring:
simulation → likelihoods → plots. Use it as a template while the real pipeline
is built out.
