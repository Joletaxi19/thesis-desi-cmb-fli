# Thesis overview

This documentation collects design notes for a thesis-scale analysis combining
DESI galaxy clustering with CMB lensing from Planck and ACT using field-level
inference (FLI). The repository is maintained as a stripped scaffold: packaging,
testing, and documentation workflows remain available so the scientific pieces
can be reimplemented with a clean slate.

These pages should capture cosmological objectives, data products, and pipeline
decisions as the project progresses from concept to a full FLI analysis.
