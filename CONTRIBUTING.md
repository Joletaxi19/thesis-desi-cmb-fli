# Contributing Guidelines

- Use feature branches (e.g., `feat/fli-likelihood`, `fix/planck-loader`).
- Keep PRs focused and small.
- Add tests and docs with every change.
- Run `pre-commit` before pushing.

Versioning
- Bump the version in `pyproject.toml`.
- Run `pre-commit` (the hook syncs `CITATION.cff` version and release date).
