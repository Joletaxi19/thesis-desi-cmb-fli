# Figures

This directory contains figures **generated by the code** (e.g., validation plots, posterior distributions, power spectra, field visualizations).

Documentation figures (e.g., pipeline diagrams) are stored in `docs/figures/`.

Consider using `.gitignore` for large output figures if needed.
